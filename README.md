# Counter

### Functional requirements - 

1. The counter can be initialised with a certain value. If no value is present at initialisation then the counter will start at 1.

2. The counter can be initialised with a max value. If no max value is present, then assume that the max value will be 1000. If a max value is present then the counter can be incremented to only that max value.

3. The user can also type a value into the counter.
